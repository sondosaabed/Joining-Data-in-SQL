# Joining-Data-in-SQL
In this course I learned how to use table joins and relational set theory on joining data. I have also learned how to work with more than one table in SQL, use inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins, leverage set theory, including unions, intersect, and except clauses, and create nested queries.
