# Joining-Data-in-SQL
In this course I learned how to use table joins and relational set theory on joining data. I have also learned how to work with more than one table in SQL, use inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins, leverage set theory, including unions, intersect, and except clauses, and create nested queries.

## Course Chapters
- **Chapter 1: Introducing Inner Joins:** In this chapter, I have learned the concept of joining tables and explored all the ways to enrich queries using joinsâ€”beginning with inner joins.
- **Chapter 2: Outer Joins, Cross Joins and Self Joins:** Came to grips with different kinds of outer joins. Learned about cross joins. Finally, I have learn about situations in which I might join a table with itself.
- **Chapter 3: Set Theory for SQL Joins:** In this chapter, I have learned about using set theory operations in SQL, with an introduction to UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT clauses. I have explored the predominant ways in which set theory operations differ from join operations.
- **Chapter 4: Subqueries:** In this closing chapter, I began by investigating semi-joins and anti-joins. I have also learned how to use nested queries. Wrapped up the course with some challenges...
